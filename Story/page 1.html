  <p> You are walking down the street in the middle of the night.
You like taking walks at night to clear your mind.
You were walking down near the water and the docks when you encounter a couple of men acting shady on the pier.
They were throwing bags and boxes of stuff into the water. It was too late for them to be working.
What do you do?
