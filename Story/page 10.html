  <h1>Call The Police</h1>
  <p> You make a break for it and hide behind building and pull out your cell phone and you dial 911. The attackers catch up with you and you have to run to a different building. You hear sirens coming and you find a hiding place. You hear the police speak with the men and they arrest them and they say you can go home(end)
