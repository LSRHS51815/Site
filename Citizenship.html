  <h1>Citizenship</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>I believe that honesty,compassion,respect,responsibilty and courage
    are neccesary components to be a good citizen.
    Citizenship is the position or status of being apart
    of a place.</li>
    <li> Honesty is the quality of being truthful and honest whenever possible.
      I belive this links to citizenship because to be
      a good citizen you have to be honest to the
      other people in the community.</li>
      <li>Compassion is being sympathetic to others and being concerned for their
      misfortunes. I believe compassion connects to citizenship
      because in a community you have to show compassion
      for others.</li>
      <li>Respect is a deep feeling of admiration
      you have for someone based on their qualities
      or achievments. To be a good citizen in a community
      you have to respect one another.</li>
      <li> Responsibility is being accountable for your actions wether they are good or bad.
        I think responsibilty and honesty are similar in that you have to be honest and
        accountable for everything you do. I think responsiblity is an important part
        of being a good citizen because if no one was resbonsible for anything then no one would
        know what to do. There wouldn't be any leaders and if anything bad ever happened no one would
        be accountable.</li>
        <li> Courage is strength in the face of fear or danger. Courage could also be trying something
          new. Courage is an important part of being a citizen because you have to be couragous sometimes to help people
          or try something new.</li>
          <p> I also think helping and supporting others is an important part of citizenship.
            I think this because if we can help and support eachother through good and bad times
            then we will have a stronger community.
